# MemoryPrototype1
This project is the first prototype of a networking game.
Game to be implemented is Memory which has 10 cards on screen and there is a 
pair for each type of card. Players have to switch manually in this prototype.
In the next prototype, a game will be built which will be played by 2 players and they both 
will be connected to a server which has all the data. Players would be 
able to flip 2 cards, if those cards match, then the player will get one point.
If they dont match then the cards will be flipped back again to the default.

This prototype does not have any server so players have to manually start 2 frames and then 
each move has to be played on both the frames.

GameFrame file has the main method
All the files submitted should be in the same folder in order to run the program successfully
Program uses pictures so those pictures should be in the same folder as well
